It's already September.

The hot summer has passed, and now it's time to gradually prepare for autumn.

In Korea, it's usually not until October that we enter the full autumn season,  
but September still retains the energy of late summer while  
mornings and evenings become gradually cooler,  
making it a great time for travel.

I personally think September is a great month to travel in Korea.  
However, during this time, there are variables like typhoons and lingering heat,  
so there are some things to be careful about.

So from now on, I'll introduce you to **the reasons why I recommend traveling to Korea in September and what to watch out for**.

## 🌤 Late Summer Weather and Typhoons

In my opinion, September has great weather for travel.  
Early September can feel slightly hot with daytime temperatures around 25-30°C, but  
mornings and evenings cool down to around 18°C, becoming refreshing.

It's not quite full autumn yet,  
but you can feel that the summer heat is gradually subsiding.

This makes it perfect for enjoying food at outdoor tables or beer in the evenings.  
It's also great weather for feeling the cool river breeze at the Han River.

**However, September is a time when typhoons frequently occur**.  
Strong wind and rain can continue for several days, so  
you must check the weather forecast before your trip.

## ✈️ Relaxed Travel Season

September is when Korea's peak summer season ends.  
This is when most Korean companies' vacation periods are over,  
and school summer breaks are also coming to an end.

So there's relatively more availability for plane tickets and hotel reservations compared to July-August,  
allowing for more comfortable travel.

Especially if you want a more relaxed trip than usual,  
September would be a great choice.

## 🌸 Early Autumn Flowers and Nature

In September, along with summer flowers,  
autumn flowers like chrysanthemums and cosmos begin to bloom gradually.

Even in urban parks like Seoul Forest, Namsan Park, and Haneul Park,  
you can enjoy autumn flowers along with the green trees.

It's not quite the full autumn foliage yet, but  
it's the perfect time to feel the "landscape transitioning from summer to autumn."

## 🧺 Picnics and the Han River

The refreshing September breeze  
creates perfect conditions for outdoor activities.

Especially, Seoul's Han River Park is a picnic hotspot.  
You can spread out a mat and enjoy chicken and beer,  
and for those who like cycling, you can rent Seoul's shared bicycles and ride along the Han River.

If you enjoy picnics, come in September and make sure to visit the Han River.

## 🎉 The Beginning of Autumn Festivals

September is still the end of summer, but  
it's also the **starting point for various autumn festivals**.

Let me introduce you to some representative festivals.

### 🎆 Seoul International Fireworks Festival (September 27)

One of Seoul's representative autumn events is the **Seoul International Fireworks Festival**.  
On September 27, countless fireworks paint the night sky against the backdrop of the Han River.

The Yeouido Han River Park area fills with people,  
and many people also enjoy the fireworks from Han River bridges and surrounding buildings.

It's a festival that brightly illuminates Seoul's night, so  
if you're coming to Korea in late September, make sure to experience it at least once.

The **Seoul Outdoor Library**, which stopped operating during the hot summer,  
resumes from September.

Every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,  
beautiful outdoor reading spaces open in major areas like Seoul City Hall, Cheonggyecheon Plaza, and Gwanghwamun Plaza.

Especially at Seoul City Hall Plaza, various performances are also held,  
and at Cheonggyecheon, you can enjoy the leisure of reading books while listening to the sound of flowing water.

Of course, since most books are in Korean, reading might be a bit difficult, but  
it's a great space to take a short break during your Seoul trip.

## 🎯 Conclusion

To summarize,  
September in Korea is a **time of transition from summer to autumn**.

It's still hot, but cool breezes blow,  
and the number of tourists decreases, allowing for relaxed travel.

However, if you prepare well for typhoons and large temperature differences,  
it will definitely be a satisfying trip.
