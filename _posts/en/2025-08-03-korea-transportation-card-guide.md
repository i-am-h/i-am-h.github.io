_Different types of Korean transportation cards_

If you're planning your first trip to Korea, you've probably come across cards like these.

But... **are they really necessary?**

Hi, I'm Guide H!

In this post, I’ll explain why transportation cards are essential in Korea, the types of cards available, and which one is best suited to your travel style.

---

## ✅ Why You Need One

You might think, “Do I really need one? Can’t I just buy tickets for the subway or bus when I need them?”

But actually, here are **important reasons** why travelers should prepare a transportation card:

### 1. **Free Transfers Between Bus & Subway**

In most major Korean cities, **free transfers** between buses and subways are available.

But here's the catch: You must use the **same card** throughout your trip for the discount to apply.

For example, if you get off the subway at Hongik Univ. Station and transfer to a bus, the transfer discount only works if you use the **same card**.

---

### 2. **Buses Don’t Accept Cash**

Most buses in the Seoul metro area **don’t accept cash**.

And unfortunately, **foreign credit cards often don't work** on Korean public transport either.

So a **transportation card is essential** for convenience and access.

---

With that in mind, let’s go over the types of cards available and which ones suit different kinds of travelers.

---

## 🥇 1. T-money

_T money_

The most basic and widely used transportation card in Korea.

You can use it on **subways, buses, taxis, and even in convenience stores**, and it works **nationwide**, including Seoul, Busan, and Jeju.

It costs about 3,000 KRW, and you load it with credit at convenience stores or machines.

### Pros
- ✅ Easy to get and use
- ✅ Works nationwide
- ✅ Rechargeable at convenience stores
- ✅ Inexpensive

### Cons

## 🥈 2. WOWPASS

_Wowpass_

WOWPASS is gaining popularity among international travelers.

It’s a **hybrid card** that works as a transportation card, a payment card, and even a currency exchange tool — all in one.

Think of it as an upgraded version of T-money.

### Key Features
- **Transport**: Works nationwide like T-money
- **Payment**: Use at any credit card terminal
