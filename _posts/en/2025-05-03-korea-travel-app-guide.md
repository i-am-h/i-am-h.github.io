Hello, this is Guide H.

In this post, I’ll introduce must-have apps for traveling in Korea.

Rather than global apps like Airbnb, Agoda, or Klook,  
I’ll focus on apps that are especially useful in Korea.

Let’s get started!
  

> **This article is based on information as of 2025. App features and specifications may change, so please check the latest details before installing!**
  
  
We also explain these apps and local tips in detail on YouTube.  
Check out the video below!

## 1️⃣ Transportation Apps

### ✅ Naver Map – Accurate Navigation & Public Transit in English

_Naver Map_

First up is Naver Map, the most widely used map app in Korea.

Many travelers use Google Maps,  
but in Korea, Naver Map is much more accurate and has richer information.  
Since it’s developed by a Korean company, it’s optimized for local data.

Public transit route searches are detailed and reliable.  
Of course, it supports English (and other languages).  
You can also easily check restaurant, cafe, and attraction hours, info, and reviews.

### ✅ Kakao T – Taxi Hailing & Public Transit Info

_Kakao Taxi_

Next is Kakao Taxi, an app for hailing taxis.

It’s similar to Uber,  
but Kakao Taxi is overwhelmingly more popular than Uber in Korea.

If you want to use taxis easily in Korea, Kakao Taxi is a must.

You set your pickup and destination, so it’s safer than hailing a cab on the street.

You can check your route in real time and make sure you’re going the right way.

Drivers tend to be polite, and overcharging is rare.

It’s convenient to register your card before your trip.

The app supports English, Japanese, and Chinese.

### ✅ Korail Talk – KTX & Train Booking

_Korail Talk_

Korail Talk is for booking long-distance trains.

If you’re only staying in Seoul, you might not need it,  
but if you plan to visit places like Busan or Gyeongju, you can book trains with this app.

You can also book via the website without installing the app.

### ✅ Seoul Bike “Ddareungi” – Convenient Bike Sharing in Seoul

_Ddareungi_

Have you seen these green bikes around Seoul?

They’re called “Ddareungi,” Seoul’s official bike sharing service.

Foreigners can use them too!

They’re available in most areas of Seoul,  
so they’re great for short trips or a picnic by the Han River.

Rental fees are affordable.

For details on how to use, check the video above.

## 2️⃣ Translation & Communication Apps

### ✅ Papago – Best for Korean Translation

_Papago_

Papago is a translation app.

Translation apps have become very accurate recently,  
so communicating with locals is much easier.

Papago supports not only text input but also real-time voice translation.

You can even take a photo of a Korean menu and see the translation overlaid on the image.

Google Translate is also available,  
but Papago, developed in Korea, is more natural for Korean translation.

In my experience, Papago’s image translation is more detailed and convenient than Google’s.

### ✅ KakaoTalk – Korea’s #1 Messenger
![KakaoTalk](/assets/img/posts/korea-travel-app/카카오톡.png)
_KakaoTalk_

KakaoTalk is the most widely used messenger in Korea.

While many people overseas use **LINE**,  
in Korea, very few people use LINE.

Younger people often use Instagram DMs,  
but almost every Korean has a KakaoTalk account.

If you want to keep in touch with Korean friends, KakaoTalk is highly recommended.  


## 3️⃣ Restaurant Booking Apps

### ✅ Catch Table – Korea’s Leading Restaurant Reservation App

_Catch Table_

Catch Table is Korea’s top restaurant reservation app.

It’s often hard to get into popular restaurants in Korea without waiting!

With Catch Table, you can make reservations in advance—super convenient.

They’ve recently started services for foreigners,  
so you can register with your email address.

Not every restaurant is listed,  
but more and more are joining the system.

Time is precious when traveling,  
so if you want to avoid waiting, definitely try Catch Table.

## 4️⃣ Payment & Currency Exchange

### ✅ WOWPASS – Korea’s Cashless Prepaid Card
![WOWPASS](/assets/img/posts/korea-travel-app/와우패스.jpeg)
_WOWPASS_

Most Koreans rarely carry cash.

Almost all payments can be made by card,  
and Samsung Pay or credit cards work almost everywhere.

Recently, you can’t use cash on buses,  
so travelers with only cash may be confused.

That’s where WOWPASS comes in handy.

WOWPASS is a prepaid card you can charge in advance.

With just this card, you can ride buses and subways and transfer between them.

It uses the credit card network, so you can pay at most restaurants too.

You can get your remaining balance refunded at an ATM when you leave Korea!
