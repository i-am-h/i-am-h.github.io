When preparing for a trip to Korea, the first thing you worry about is **how to get from Incheon International Airport to downtown Seoul**.  
There are various options like buses, taxis, and express trains, but today I'll introduce **the most economical and reasonable method**,  
which is using the **Airport Railroad Regular Train (A'REX All-Stop Train)**.

---

## 🚆 Main Transportation Options from Incheon Airport to Downtown Seoul
- **Airport Limousine Bus** → Comfortable but somewhat expensive  
- **Taxi** → Most convenient but expensive (especially during late night hours)  
- **Airport Railroad (A'REX)** → Reasonable fare and fast transportation  

| Transportation | Fare | Duration | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------------|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Airport Limousine Bus** | 17,000~18,000 won | 60~80 min | Comfort, guaranteed seats, easy luggage storage | Delays during traffic jams, expensive fare |
| **Taxi** | 60,000~100,000 won | Within 60 min | Door-to-door service, 24-hour availability | Very expensive fare, late night surcharge |
| **Airport Railroad Regular Train** | 4,450 won | About 1 hour | Cheap fare, punctuality, convenient transfers | May need to stand during rush hours |

> **TIP:**  
> If you want to save money, choose the Airport Railroad Regular Train,  
> If you want comfort, choose the Limousine Bus,    
> If you want fast door-to-door service, choose a taxi!

Among these, the **most cost-effective choice** is definitely the **Airport Railroad Regular Train**.  
As long as you can tolerate a little inconvenience!

### Route Check

First, we need to know the route we want to take, right?
Most of you probably use Google Maps.

_Naver Map_

However, Naver Map has much more data and is more accurate in Korea, so please use Naver Map for Korean travel.
When you use Naver Map to set your desired destination, it will show you the optimal route, travel time, and price information like below.

**Using Naver Map, you can easily and accurately find public transportation routes not only from Incheon Airport to downtown Seoul,  
but anywhere in Korea, so please try using it.**

Finally arrived at our destination, Yangcheonhyanggyo Station.

![Deposit refund machine](/assets/img/posts/incheonairport-to-seoul/deposit-refund-machine.jpg)
_Subway deposit refund machine_

In this video, I explained using subway tickets.
Since this ticket can refund a 500 won deposit,
when you get off, you can return the card to a machine like above and get a 500 won cash refund.
WOWPASS or T-money cards don't have this process, so they're much more convenient.
